## Default (built-in) skin swapping

Taterzens mod supports setting custom skins to NPCs
if their [type](./types.html) is set to `PLAYER`.
All skins are **cached** after being set, meaning that they
will stay the same *even if player that skin was fetched from changes their skin*.

You can set any skin from any minecraft player using
```
/npc edit skin <minecraft player name>
```


## Custom skins

To use the skins to their fullest potential, you will need
to install [FabricTailor](https://modrinth.com/mod/FabricTailor) mod.
After installing it, *select* the desired NPC you wish to change skin for.

When having a Taterzen selected, simply run FabricTailor's [`/skin`](https://github.com/samolego/FabricTailor/wiki) command
```
/skin set <follow the wiki or brigadier suggestions>
```
