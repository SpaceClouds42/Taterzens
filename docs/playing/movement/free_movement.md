# Free Movement

---


## We have our own rights!

1. If you have a non-escapable area, you can use the following command
```
/npc edit movement FREE
```
as it makes the Taterzen move around freely with no restrictions.


2. For following the [path](../path.html) but enabling *long* rests and looking around, use
```
/npc edit movement PATH
```
