# Messages

## Make them speak!

Taterzens are simple creatures; you enter
their message editor and they will remember things
you send in chat.

You can edit those messages later or even delete them,
if you don't like them anymore.


```
/npc edit messages list
```

will show you all the messages of selected Taterzen.

## And then?

The NPC will send those messages to any player in range, with a certain delay.
It can be changed in config, look for the `messageDelay` option.
