## Changing language


The default provided language file is `en_us.json`.

It's up to you whether you'll edit the values directly or create a custom
file with translated messages. When doing the latter, make sure you edit the
`language` field in your `config.json`.

```diff
{
-  "language": "en_us"
+  "language": "custom_language"
}
```
